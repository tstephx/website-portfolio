            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Every role I've ever had started with an inherited mess. At Amazon, it was a process that took four months, cost $25M a year, and had everyone firefighting individual cases.</p>
            <p>My instinct isn't to patch &mdash; it's to dig. I go 5&ndash;8 layers deep on root cause analysis, map the full lifecycle, and find the breakdowns no one else sees &mdash; usually upstream, invisible unless you get into the details. Most people fix symptoms. I find the system underneath and rebuild it. That's how four months becomes two weeks.</p>
            <p>When I'm not rebuilding systems, I'm watching them &mdash; F1 strategy calls and Arsenal set pieces are my version of relaxation. I'm a UW MBA who once bought a one-way ticket to Bangkok and spent 18 months figuring it out across Asia and Latin America. Always happy to swap travel tips or argue about tire strategy.</p>

                <h3><a href="work/contract-transfer.html">Contract Transfer Process Scaling</a></h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Sole Process Owner | 680% Volume Growth | Zero Additional Headcount</p>
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Amazon's DSP ownership transfer process was manual, ad-hoc, and had a 15-case backlog. Annual volume was about to explode from 5 cases to 63+ with no additional staff, no documentation, and no data infrastructure.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> I redesigned the entire workflow into a structured 14-week, 21-milestone framework. Built SQL-based analytics on Amazon Redshift tracking 689 data attributes across 209 candidates. Authored the CT Process Playbook, created 19 standardized communication templates, and developed a defect tracking system with 5-Why root cause analysis.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Scaled the program 680% single-handedly while maintaining 80&ndash;100% post-transfer quality. Projected $25M in annual savings by 2026 through exit cost optimization. Reframed the function from &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; to &ldquo;network protection,&rdquo; changing how leadership valued and resourced the program.</p>

                <h3><a href="work/pinnacle-scoring.html">Pinnacle BPR Scoring Methodology Redesign</a></h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Root Cause Analysis | 198 Interview Records | Mathematical Proof</p>
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Amazon's gateway interview for DSP expansion saw approval rates collapse from 86% to 56%. No one could explain why qualified candidates were being rejected at unprecedented rates.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> I reverse-engineered the scoring formula from 198 interview records and proved it contained a mathematical flaw &mdash; a single dissenting panelist could override two supporters. Designed a hybrid replacement methodology (60% Median + 25% Vote Weight + 15% Deliverables Quality), created 33 behaviorally anchored rubric items across four categories, and built calibration protocols for panelist training.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Eliminated the single-dissent veto problem entirely. Reduced extreme scoring variance from 77% of panels to a target of under 15-point average gaps &mdash; a 63%+ reduction. Restored the approval pathway to a 65&ndash;70% target rate, unblocking a critical growth pipeline.</p>

                <h3><a href="work/dsp-application.html">DSP Application Redesign</a></h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Product Strategy | 17 Countries | $2.1M+ Entitlement Capture</p>
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Amazon's delivery partner application hadn't been updated since 2018. It had a 74% abandonment rate, took 3+ hours to complete, and only 23% of approved candidates converted to program inclination &mdash; leaving $2.1M&ndash;$2.35M in annual entitlement on the table.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> I benchmarked against Chick-fil-A's franchise application (152 questions vs. our 71, yet higher completion), authored a BRD with 50+ user stories, and designed a modular multi-stage architecture supporting 6 acquisition channels across 17 countries. Replaced 20 complex questions with single-response formats and proposed a Pardot integration that cut the development timeline from 10&ndash;12 months to 3&ndash;4 months.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Projected completion rate increase from 26% to 60% (+130%), program inclination from 23% to 46% (+100%), and 6,087 additional approved applications annually. Reduced time per question from 3.51 minutes to 1.5 minutes.</p>

                <p class="project-meta">SQL Architecture | Haversine Formula | From Crashing Excel to Real-Time</p>
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The Pinnacle eligibility process ran on a 55+ MB Excel file with index-match calculations across 24,000 rows that regularly crashed. It used inconsistent traffic-dependent distance calculations, had quarterly data lag, and caused Pinnacle launches to drop 55% (93 to 42) while 20 eligible candidates were bypassed entirely.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> I diagnosed root causes across data, process, and tooling dimensions. Designed and built a 6-step SQL query architecture on Amazon Redshift, implemented the Haversine distance formula for consistent geospatial calculations, created a multi-source data integration pipeline, and built an outreach prioritization ranking algorithm connected to Salesforce.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Pinnacle fill rate jumped from 57.9% to 94.1% (+36 percentage points), with July hitting 100%. Preserved 20 eligible candidates from being bypassed. Replaced a fragile manual process with an automated, real-time system.</p>
