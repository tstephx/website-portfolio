## One-Sentence Test (the spine)

> *Amazon's $500M delivery network had no structured way to transfer business ownership — a process held together by tribal knowledge across eight teams, with no SOP, no communications to DSP owners, and every failed transition costing $482K–$504K in exit costs. Taylor inherited 29 active cases and a 15-case backlog in Q3 2022, built a 14-week operating system from scratch, and transformed CT into the infrastructure behind a $25M strategic initiative.*

## Case Study

---

**Amazon's $500M delivery network had no way to hand a business from one owner to another.**

When a DSP owner wanted to retire, bring in a family member, or sell to an employee, there was no structured path. What existed was a process built for arm's-length third-party sales — inconsistent, undocumented, and held together by tribal knowledge across eight teams. When Taylor inherited it in Q3 2022, there were 29 active cases and a 15-case backlog. There was no SOP. There were zero standardized communications to DSP owners. And every DSP exit the program failed to prevent cost Amazon an average of $482K–$504K and degraded network capacity by 7.7%.

---

### The Organization's Goal

The DSP Acquisitions team needed a reliable mechanism to transition ownership of delivery businesses — preserving network capacity, maintaining quality standards, and giving DSP owners a legitimate path to exit without abandoning their routes. The Contract Transfer program existed in name. It didn't work in practice.

---

### What Was Broken

The inherited process failed in four compounding ways:

- **No one knew how it worked**: The process lived in tribal knowledge across eight teams — BCs, BDMs, Acquisitions, Legal, Network Health, DRR, DSS, Marketing Technology. Role boundaries were undefined. Decision authority was unclear. New cases were handled differently every time.
- **Candidates and owners were left in silence**: Only 4 standardized communications existed — all sent to candidates only. DSP owners received nothing. During a high-stakes business transition involving legal agreements, financial arrangements, and family dynamics, both parties regularly went weeks without any contact.
- **Vetting was inconsistent**: An 89% overall rejection rate with no rubric behind it. Disqualifying factors were caught at different stages depending on who reviewed the case — wasting candidate time, team time, and creating defensibility risk on rejections.
- **Every failed transition became an exit**: DSP exits reduced network Capacity Reliability by 7.7%, with only 39.6% of routes recovered. The remaining 60.4% were rerouted at higher cost or covered by expensive third-party solutions.

The business was absorbing $482K–$504K per DSP exit that a functioning CT process could have prevented.

### Taylor's Role

Taylor inherited the program as a single-point-of-failure operation — one person holding together an undocumented process across eight teams, with no institutional knowledge documented anywhere.

The mandate: transform CT from a reactive case queue into a scalable, defensible operating system. No additional headcount. No dedicated tech resources. Everything built from scratch.

---

### What Taylor Did

**Step 1: Eliminate the backlog, understand the system.**

The 15-case inherited backlog was cleared by end of Q3 2022 through systematic triage — categorizing cases by type, stage, and blocking issue, then working each to resolution. This wasn't just cleanup. It was the diagnostic. Working through 15 stalled cases revealed exactly where the process broke down: unclear intake criteria, undefined role boundaries, no stage-gate logic, no communication cadence.

**Step 2: Build the operating system.**

Taylor designed the CT process from scratch — a 14-week, 21-milestone framework spanning five phases: Notification → Intake → Vetting → Approvals → Onboarding. Each phase had defined SLAs, explicit ownership assignments, and documented handoff criteria.

The vetting sequence was front-loaded by design — cheapest gates first:

1. Application review against a 6-dimension rubric (automatic disqualifiers defined)
2. Background and credit check
3. HireVue video assessment
4. Enhanced vetting via DRR
5. Station visit
6. Interview loop

This sequencing meant the 89% of candidates who didn't qualify were identified early — before the expensive stages.

**Step 3: End the silence.**

Taylor authored 19 email templates covering every lifecycle state for both DSP owners and candidates — intake confirmation, phase progression, 2-week cadence updates during review periods, rejection at each stage, conditional approval, onboarding kickoff. Separate tracks, separate tone, legally reviewed language throughout.

Moving from 4 candidate-only emails to 19 templates covering both audiences eliminated the extended silences that had driven escalations and created legal exposure on rejections.

**Step 4: Decentralize the knowledge.**

Taylor authored a complete operational toolkit: CT Process Playbook, BC/BDM Playbook with role boundaries and talking points, Application Review Rubric, HireVue Assessment Rubric, Interview Question Bank, Survivorship framework (4 sub-scenarios with graduated vetting requirements), and a Buyer Supplementary Questionnaire capturing deal-specific data the standard application missed.

13 appendix artifacts. Any new CT PM, BC, or BDM could pick up the playbook and execute without institutional knowledge transfer.

**Step 5: Define what "approved" means.**

Taylor designed a 5-stakeholder consensus approval model — BC Manager, Acquisitions Manager, NH Manager, Legal, NH Director — requiring 100% agreement before any transfer was confirmed. No single point of decision failure. No ambiguity about who had authority.

### The Decision That Held It Together

When the process revealed that the HireVue bottleneck (weekly Thursday cadence + 1-week completion window + 1-week review) was adding 3 weeks of structural delay regardless of candidate quality, Taylor documented it explicitly in the SOP rather than working around it — flagging it as a root cause for future automation rather than absorbing it silently. That discipline — naming the problems the process couldn't yet solve — is what made the SOP trustworthy as a handoff document.

### The Outcome

| Metric | Inherited | Built |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Annual case volume | 29 (2021) | 63+ |
| Backlog | 15 cases | 0 |
| Standardized owner communications | 0 | 19 templates |
| Process documentation | None | SOP + 13 appendices |
| Time to decision | 4+ months | 2 weeks |
| Non-3P post-transfer quality | Unknown | +1,800 bps vs. network |
| Exit cost avoidance | Baseline | $13M (29 approved transfers) |

**Every approved transfer is an exit that didn't happen.** At $482K–$504K per DSP exit, 29 successful transfers represents $13M in costs Amazon didn't absorb — and 29 routes that never dropped off the network.

The SOP became the foundation for the 2025 Legacy Transfer strategy — a leadership-level initiative to formalize internal succession pathways. Taylor is named owner of three of four implementation workstreams.

### What This Story Is Really About

*A program held together by one person's tribal knowledge is not a program — it's a liability. What Taylor built wasn't just a process. It was the infrastructure that let the program survive, scale, and become the foundation for a $25M strategic initiative.*

## Flags (resolve before HTML)

1. **63+ cases** — confirm this is the current number, not a 2022 figure
2. **"The Decision That Held It Together"** — softer than the DSP equivalent; swap in a harder pivot moment if one exists
3. **First vs. third person** — uses "Taylor" throughout; revert to "I" if site is first-person
