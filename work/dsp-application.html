            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Amazon&rsquo;s Delivery Service Partner application hadn&rsquo;t been updated since 2018. It had a 74% abandonment rate, took 3+ hours to complete, and only 23% of approved candidates converted to program inclination. The math was stark: $2.1M&ndash;$2.35M in annual entitlement was sitting on the table because qualified candidates gave up before finishing.</p>

            <p>The application wasn&rsquo;t just old &mdash; it was hostile. Complex questions requiring external research, no save-and-continue functionality, and a monolithic structure that gave applicants no sense of progress. Candidates who would make excellent delivery partners were abandoning because the application itself was a barrier.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="cs-section" id="approach">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>I started with competitive benchmarking. If our 71-question application had 74% abandonment, how did other franchise-style programs handle applications? The answer revealed the opportunity: Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s franchise application had 152 questions &mdash; more than double ours &mdash; yet achieved higher completion rates. The difference wasn&rsquo;t length; it was design.</p>

            <table class="data-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>

            <h3>Three-Part Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Benchmark and diagnose:</strong> Analyze Chick-fil-A and other franchise applications to identify what makes long applications completable.</li>
                <li><strong>Redesign the architecture:</strong> Move from a monolithic form to a modular multi-stage system with save-and-continue, progress indicators, and question simplification.</li>
                <li><strong>Accelerate delivery:</strong> Propose a Pardot integration that would cut development timeline from 10&ndash;12 months to 3&ndash;4 months.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="cs-section" id="technical">
            <h2>Key Decisions</h2>

            <h3>Modular Multi-Stage Architecture</h3>
            <p>The original application was one long form. I designed a multi-stage architecture with clear sections: eligibility screening, financial verification, operational planning, and final submission. Each stage could be saved and continued later, and applicants could see exactly where they were in the process.</p>

            <h3>Question Simplification</h3>
            <p>Twenty of the original 71 questions required external research (financial documents, business plans, etc.) and complex multi-part responses. I redesigned these as single-response formats wherever possible, moving the complex gathering to later stages when candidates were already invested.</p>

            <h3>Six Acquisition Channels</h3>
            <p>The original application assumed everyone arrived the same way. The redesign supported 6 different acquisition channels across 17 countries, with channel-appropriate entry points and field pre-population where data was already known.</p>

            <h3>Pardot Integration</h3>
            <p>The original timeline called for 10&ndash;12 months of custom development. I proposed integrating with Pardot (already in the tech stack) for form management and progressive profiling, cutting the timeline to 3&ndash;4 months by leveraging existing infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>Before / After</h3>
            <div class="comparison">
                <div class="comparison-before">
                    <h3>Before</h3>
                    <p>74% abandonment rate. 3+ hours to complete. No save-and-continue. 23% program inclination. 3.51 minutes per question. Monolithic form. Last updated 2018. $2.1M+ left on table.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The redesign projected completion rates increasing from 26% to 60% (+130%) and program inclination from 23% to 46% (+100%). At scale, this translated to 6,087 additional approved applications annually and $2.1M+ in captured entitlement that was previously being lost to abandonment.</p>
            <p>Time per question dropped from 3.51 minutes to 1.5 minutes &mdash; not by removing questions, but by restructuring how they were asked. The Pardot integration cut delivery timeline by 70%, enabling faster time-to-value.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <ul class="lessons-list">
                <li>Length isn&rsquo;t the enemy of completion &mdash; design is. Chick-fil-A asks 152 questions and gets higher completion than our 71. The difference is structure, progress visibility, and question design.</li>
                <li>Competitive benchmarking against non-obvious competitors (franchise applications, not just delivery programs) reveals unexpected best practices.</li>
                <li>The fastest path to delivery often runs through existing infrastructure. Pardot was already in the stack; using it cut 7 months off the timeline.</li>
