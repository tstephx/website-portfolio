            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Amazon&rsquo;s gateway interview for DSP expansion &mdash; the Pinnacle Business Partner Review (BPR) &mdash; was failing. Approval rates had collapsed from 86% to 56%, and no one could explain why. Qualified candidates were being rejected at unprecedented rates, blocking a critical growth pipeline.</p>
            <p>Leadership assumed the problem was calibration: panelists weren&rsquo;t scoring consistently. But when I started digging, the data told a different story. The problem wasn&rsquo;t the panelists &mdash; it was the formula itself.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="cs-section" id="approach">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>I approached this as a forensic analysis. Before proposing solutions, I needed to understand exactly why the system was producing bad outcomes. That meant reverse-engineering the scoring formula from historical data.</p>

            <h3>Three-Phase Investigation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data extraction:</strong> Pull 198 interview records with individual panelist scores, final outcomes, and candidate metadata.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula reconstruction:</strong> Reverse-engineer the exact formula being used by analyzing how individual scores mapped to final decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Root cause identification:</strong> Identify the specific mathematical property causing qualified candidates to be rejected.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="cs-section" id="technical">
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>

            <h3>The Mathematical Flaw</h3>
            <p>The scoring formula had a hidden property: a single dissenting panelist could override two supporters. If two panelists scored a candidate highly but one scored them low, the formula weighted the low score heavily enough to trigger rejection. This meant a 2-1 favorable panel could still result in a &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

            <div class="vote-comparison">
                <div class="vote-scenario scenario-old">
                    <h4>Old Formula</h4>
                    <div class="vote-icons">
                        <div class="vote-icon vote-yes">+</div>
                        <div class="vote-icon vote-yes">+</div>
                        <div class="vote-icon vote-no">&minus;</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="vote-result result-rejected">Rejected</div>
                    <p class="vote-caption">One low score vetoes two high scores</p>
                </div>
                <div class="vote-scenario scenario-new">
                    <h4>New Median-Based Formula</h4>
                    <div class="vote-icons">
                        <div class="vote-icon vote-yes">+</div>
                        <div class="vote-icon vote-yes">+</div>
                        <div class="vote-icon vote-no">&minus;</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="vote-result result-approved">Approved</div>
                    <p class="vote-caption">Median score resists outliers</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This wasn&rsquo;t a calibration problem &mdash; it was structural. No amount of panelist training would fix a formula that mathematically allowed one voice to override two.</p>

            <h3>Extreme Scoring Variance</h3>
            <p>The data showed that 77% of panels had extreme scoring variance &mdash; gaps of 15+ points between panelists on the same candidate. Combined with the single-dissent veto, this variance was creating chaotic outcomes that didn&rsquo;t reflect actual candidate quality.</p>

            <h3>The Replacement Methodology</h3>
            <p>I designed a hybrid scoring system that eliminated the veto problem while preserving signal quality:</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <div class="formula-label">New Scoring Formula</div>
                <div class="formula">
                    Final Score = <span class="accent">60%</span> Median + <span class="accent">25%</span> Vote Weight + <span class="accent">15%</span> Deliverables
                </div>
                <p class="formula-note">Median score resists outliers; vote weight captures panel alignment; deliverables add objectivity</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>60% Median Score:</strong> The middle score across panelists &mdash; resistant to outliers in either direction.</li>
                <li><strong>25% Vote Weight:</strong> A simple majority component (2-1 for, 2-1 against) that captures panelist alignment.</li>
                <li><strong>15% Deliverables Quality:</strong> Objective scoring of candidate-submitted materials, reducing subjectivity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rubric Redesign</h3>
            <p>Beyond the formula, I created 33 behaviorally anchored rubric items across four categories. Each score level (1&ndash;5) had specific, observable behaviors attached &mdash; removing the ambiguity that led to wild scoring variation. I also built calibration protocols for panelist training, using historical edge cases to align scoring standards.</p>

            <p>The new methodology eliminated the single-dissent veto problem entirely. Extreme scoring variance dropped from 77% of panels to a target of under 15-point average gaps &mdash; a 63%+ reduction. The approval pathway was restored to a 65&ndash;70% target rate, unblocking a critical growth pipeline that had been stalled for months.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <ul class="lessons-list">
                <li>When a system produces bad outcomes, the problem is often structural, not behavioral. Training people harder doesn&rsquo;t fix a broken formula.</li>
                <li>Proving a flaw exists is harder than fixing it. The reverse-engineering work to demonstrate the veto property took longer than designing the replacement.</li>
                <li>Behaviorally anchored rubrics transform subjective judgment into something closer to objective measurement &mdash; panelists can still disagree, but at least they&rsquo;re disagreeing about the same observable behaviors.</li>
            </ul>
