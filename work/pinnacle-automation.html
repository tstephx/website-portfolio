            <p class="cs-tagline">Replacing a fragile 55MB Excel file with SQL-based automation that increased Pinnacle fill rate from 57.9% to 94.1% &mdash; hitting 100% in July.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The Pinnacle eligibility process &mdash; determining which delivery partners qualified for premium station assignments &mdash; ran on a 55+ MB Excel file with INDEX-MATCH calculations across 24,000 rows. It crashed regularly, used inconsistent traffic-dependent distance calculations, had quarterly data lag, and was maintained by a single person who built it years ago.</p>

            <div class="bar-comparison">
                <div class="bar-comparison-item">
                    <div class="bar-comparison-label">
                        <span>Pinnacle Launches (Before)</span>
                        <span class="bar-value">93 launches</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bar-track">
                        <div class="bar-fill muted" style="width: 100%"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="bar-comparison-item">
                    <div class="bar-comparison-label">
                        <span>Pinnacle Launches (Broken System)</span>
                        <span class="bar-value">42 launches</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bar-track">
                        <div class="bar-fill" style="width: 45%; background: #dc3545;"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The results were predictable: Pinnacle launches dropped 55% (from 93 to 42) and 20 eligible candidates were bypassed entirely because the system couldn&rsquo;t reliably identify them. A critical growth program was throttled by a spreadsheet that couldn&rsquo;t handle its own data.</p>

        <section class="cs-section" id="approach">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>I diagnosed root causes across three dimensions: data (inconsistent, lagging), process (single point of failure, no documentation), and tooling (Excel couldn&rsquo;t scale). The solution needed to address all three simultaneously.</p>

            <h3>Three-Layer Solution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data layer:</strong> Create a multi-source integration pipeline feeding fresh data into Amazon Redshift &mdash; eliminating quarterly lag.</li>
                <li><strong>Logic layer:</strong> Implement the Haversine distance formula in SQL for consistent geospatial calculations &mdash; eliminating traffic-dependent variability.</li>
                <li><strong>Delivery layer:</strong> Build an outreach prioritization algorithm connected to Salesforce &mdash; enabling automated, ranked candidate identification.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="cs-section" id="technical">
            <h2>Key Decisions</h2>

            <h3>Haversine Distance Formula</h3>
            <p>The original Excel file used driving distances from a mapping API, which varied based on traffic conditions. The same partner-to-station pair could show different distances depending on when you checked. I implemented the Haversine formula for great-circle distance calculations &mdash; consistent, reproducible, and fast. While driving distance is more accurate in absolute terms, consistency mattered more for eligibility ranking.</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <div class="formula-label">Haversine Formula</div>
                <div class="formula">
                    d = 2r &middot; arcsin(&radic;(sin&sup2;(&Delta;&phi;/2) + cos(&phi;1) &middot; cos(&phi;2) &middot; sin&sup2;(&Delta;&lambda;/2)))
                </div>
                <p class="formula-note">Great-circle distance between two points on a sphere &mdash; consistent, reproducible, traffic-independent</p>
            </div>

            <h3>6-Step SQL Query Architecture</h3>
            <p>The transformation from raw data to prioritized outreach list required six sequential steps: (1) data extraction from multiple sources, (2) partner qualification filtering, (3) station requirement matching, (4) distance calculation via Haversine, (5) scoring and ranking, and (6) Salesforce-ready output formatting. Each step was a modular query that could be tested and maintained independently.</p>

            <h3>Multi-Source Data Integration</h3>
            <p>The Excel file had been updated quarterly by manually copying data from various systems. The new architecture pulled directly from source systems into Redshift on a daily refresh cycle. This eliminated both the data lag and the manual effort of maintaining the spreadsheet.</p>

            <h3>Salesforce Integration</h3>
            <p>The final step wasn&rsquo;t just a list &mdash; it was an actionable queue in Salesforce with prioritization logic baked in. Recruiters could work through candidates in optimal order without needing to understand the underlying eligibility calculations.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Pinnacle fill rate jumped from 57.9% to 94.1% &mdash; a 36 percentage point increase &mdash; with July hitting 100%. The 20 eligible candidates who had been bypassed by the old system were identified and preserved. The crashing, quarterly-lagged Excel file was replaced with an automated, real-time system that required no manual maintenance.</p>
            <p>Beyond the metrics, the system eliminated a critical single point of failure. The previous process depended on one person&rsquo;s Excel expertise; the new process was documented, modular, and maintainable by anyone with SQL access.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <ul class="lessons-list">
                <li>Excel heroics are a sign of missing infrastructure. A 55MB file with 24,000-row INDEX-MATCH formulas is a system screaming for a database.</li>
                <li>Consistency often beats accuracy. Haversine distances aren&rsquo;t as &ldquo;accurate&rdquo; as driving distances, but they&rsquo;re reproducible &mdash; and reproducibility is what eligibility decisions require.</li>
                <li>Single points of failure aren&rsquo;t just risk &mdash; they&rsquo;re indicators. When a process depends on one person&rsquo;s spreadsheet, that process is already broken.</li>
