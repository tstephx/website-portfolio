            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Amazon&rsquo;s Delivery Service Partner (DSP) ownership transfer process was broken. When I inherited it, there was a 15-case backlog, no documentation, no data infrastructure, and every case was handled ad-hoc. The process took four months per transfer, cost the company through extended exit payments, and had everyone firefighting individual cases.</p>

            <div class="bar-comparison">
                <div class="bar-comparison-item">
                    <div class="bar-comparison-label">
                        <span>Previous Annual Volume</span>
                        <span class="bar-value">5 cases</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bar-track">
                        <div class="bar-fill muted" style="width: 8%"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="bar-comparison-item">
                    <div class="bar-comparison-label">
                        <span>New Annual Volume</span>
                        <span class="bar-value">63+ cases</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bar-track">
                        <div class="bar-fill" style="width: 100%"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The volume was about to explode: from 5 cases annually to 63+ &mdash; a 680% increase &mdash; with no additional staff allocated. Without fundamental redesign, the backlog would become unmanageable and the program would collapse.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="cs-section" id="approach">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>I approached this as a systems problem, not a workload problem. The goal wasn&rsquo;t to work faster on a broken process &mdash; it was to redesign the process so it could scale without breaking.</p>

            <h3>Three-Phase Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standardize the workflow:</strong> Convert ad-hoc case handling into a structured 14-week, 21-milestone framework with clear handoffs and decision points.</li>
                <li><strong>Build the data infrastructure:</strong> Create SQL-based analytics on Amazon Redshift tracking 689 data attributes across 209 candidates &mdash; replacing scattered spreadsheets with a single source of truth.</li>
                <li><strong>Institutionalize the knowledge:</strong> Author the CT Process Playbook, create 19 standardized communication templates, and build a defect tracking system with 5-Why root cause analysis.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="cs-section" id="technical">
            <h2>Key Decisions</h2>

            <h3>Milestone-Based Workflow</h3>
            <p>The original process had no structure &mdash; cases moved forward when someone remembered to push them. I designed a 14-week timeline with 21 specific milestones, each with defined owners, deliverables, and escalation triggers. This turned an amorphous &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; into a sequence of discrete, trackable steps.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item completed">

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>SQL Analytics on Redshift</h3>
            <p>The team had been tracking cases in spreadsheets that kept getting corrupted or lost. I built a proper analytics layer on Amazon Redshift, tracking 689 data attributes per candidate across 209 total candidates. This enabled real-time visibility into pipeline health, bottleneck identification, and quality metrics.</p>

            <h3>Defect Tracking with 5-Why Analysis</h3>
            <p>When transfers failed post-completion, the team would fix the immediate issue and move on. I implemented systematic 5-Why root cause analysis for every defect, categorizing failures by source and feeding insights back into process improvements. This shifted the team from reactive firefighting to proactive prevention.</p>

            <p>The program scaled 680% with a single process owner &mdash; me &mdash; while maintaining 80&ndash;100% post-transfer quality. The projected $25M in annual savings came from exit cost optimization: faster, cleaner transfers meant less time paying exiting partners.</p>
            <p>Perhaps more importantly, I reframed how leadership viewed the function. It wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; handling partner requests &mdash; it was &ldquo;network protection&rdquo; ensuring the delivery network maintained quality during transitions. This reframing changed how the program was valued and resourced.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <ul class="lessons-list">
                <li>Process problems masquerading as workload problems are the most dangerous &mdash; throwing more people at a broken process just creates more chaos.</li>
                <li>The act of creating structure creates capacity. A 21-milestone framework doesn&rsquo;t just track work; it reveals where work is actually getting stuck.</li>
                <li>Reframing how leadership sees a function (&ldquo;customer service&rdquo; → &ldquo;network protection&rdquo;) can matter more than the metrics themselves.</li>
